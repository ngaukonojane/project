      <p><i>Admission to our school is non-discriminatory and open to all students without regard to race, sex, religion, physical ability, sexual orientation or national or ethnic origin. We invite applications from students who can benefit from an international, university preparatory English language education.</i></p>

      <p>We use a Kenya National Examination Council grading and/or age placement scale for class admission. In cases where students come from a school using a different grade level system, students will be placed according to Our school's grade system. The same is true for age placement.</p>

      <p>If a student's admission to ISK is not possible, it is most likely due to one or more of the following reasons:
        <li>Class size has reached capacity</li>
         <li>Student has severe learning needs which ISK can not accommodate</li>
         <li>The managed number of mild or moderate Learning Support students in the grade applied for is at its maximum</li>
          <li>Student has a history of discipline, drug or alcohol problems</li>
          <li>Other reasons which may be in the best interest of the school and the student as determined by the Principal or Director of ISK</li>
